#### Understanding the Wall-Sit:
An optimal wall-sit forms a right angle (90 degrees) at your hips and your knees with your back fully flat against the wall, and both your heels are on the ground, placed hip-width apart. You are free to place your hands wherever you feel comfortable.

#### Rules:
1) Wall-sits will be decided primarily on the form and then the duration. 
2) The PaceMakers' member who is able to hold the perfect form for the longest duration will be judged winner. 
3) Loss of form: Removal of back from the wall; loss of 90-degrees angle at the hip and/or knees, shuffling of the ankle to move... are all grounds for elimination.  
4) In the event of a tied result, the referee will conduct a tie-breaker wall-sit for the tied participants.
5) Separate challenges for men and women
6) Coach Pani/appointed referees will eliminate on-the-fly
7) Coach Pani/appointed referees decision is final and binding
8) Camera must be positioned so as to give the referees a clear view of the hips, knees and feet. You can use the attached creative a guidance to ensure that you position your camera and provide the referees the same view.
