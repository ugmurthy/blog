1. Some Nasty 11ty build errors

* An error indicating circular reference between files in main dir (eg contact.njk) and blog posts in blog directory could not be resolved and therefore rolled back to previous commit
* going back to the previous commit required a bit of reading about git

<pre>
<code>
 # Reset to previous commit
 $ git reset --hard HEAD
 # additional info - using HEAD~1 instead of HEAD will take 
 # you back one previous commit
 # The --hard ensure that working tree is as it was 
 # after the targetted commit

 # some addition stuff i learnt on the way
 $ cat .git/HEAD
 ref: refs/heads/master

 $ cat .git/refs/heads/master
 2eb7fc1fba340db8f552755a201121fb63c5e0c7

 $ git log -1
 commit 2eb7fc1fba340db8f552755a201121fb63c5e0c7 (HEAD -> master)

 # Not that the two hashes are the same. indicating HEAD points to master branch

</code>
</pre>

2. Some pitfalls.

* I used `netlify.com` to deploy the site. Netlify can be configured to pick up the repo from github.com
* for some reason netlify build does not ignore `node_modules` during the build process and this could end up in build error
* 11ty, while building locally ignores the `node_modules` without any specific action on part of the developer
* Fix: Add `node_modules` to `.gitignore`

3. Sources of data.

* be sure to read [11ty Source of data](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/data/)
* I wanted access to site wide access to some variables. The best place for that is a json file in `_data` directory
* variable `showkeywords` is used to show keywords in the left column. One can switch it off by making the value zero
